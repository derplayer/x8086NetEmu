This is a (work in progress) C# fork/port of the x8086NetEmu Emulator by morphx666.
If you want to use the original VB.NET implementation click [here](https://github.com/morphx666/x8086NetEmu)!

There are a few things, that weren't ported over (at least for now) because i don't need them:
- No VGA/EGA (Only CGA/MDA)
- Only Console frontend (no WebUI & WinForms)
- No Sound Adapters (Adlib, Speaker)
- 8087 FPU is disabled
